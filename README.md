# Planner
Homework 5

In this app, the user can save the events of the day by the hour.
It starts at 9:00 a.m. and ends at 5:00 p.m. The user may type in the tasks/events and save them (in localStorage).

The current day will be displayed on top of the planner.

Each hour will be color coded to indicate past, present, or future hour.
